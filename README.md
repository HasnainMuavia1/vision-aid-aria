## VisionAid

VisionAid is an AI-powered medical assistant for the blind and visually impaired, offering voice-controlled, hands-free insights into medical images, prescriptions, and health routines. It interprets X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans, translating them into clear, spoken information. VisionAid reads out prescription details—medications, dosages, and instructions—and provides alerts on side effects and interactions, promoting safe use. Users can set medication reminders and schedule appointments using voice commands. Tailored for accessibility, VisionAid empowers users with essential health information and fosters independent healthcare management.
